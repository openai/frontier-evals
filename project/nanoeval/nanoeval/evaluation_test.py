    Regression test. Previous bug:

    1. nanoeval thinks that as long as an executor is alive, life is good, and it won't reassign the task away
    2. executors basically label tasks from sqlite as "mine," insert them into an internal queue, and process them in order
    3. if one of the 1st tasks crashes the executor, the internal queue is lost. usually this is fine because this
       raises an exception in the driver which causes the driver+worker to crash, but if this doesn't happen then the worker
       will be a zombie and the pid stays around.

       The driver might not crash if two evals are run, which would previously trigger *too many* executor tasks to be
       assigned to the executor pool. The first set of exception listeners would all terminate with the first successful
       eval, but the second eval would reuse the executors from the first evals now with *no exception listeners*!
    4. if the pid stays around, you get "zombie" tasks that are associated with an executor but not actually queued up
       to run anywhere! a terrible bug.

    NOTE: If regression test fails, it will hang forever rather than crashing.
